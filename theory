light weight framework
creating interfaces(as it creates an abstraction layer ) and then subclasses is better than creating classes directly--for programming
POJO---plain old java classes---it should inherit from any class and the variables cdeclared inside the class should have setter and getter methods
loose coupling---low dependency
